Its mission is to create financial products that are open, intuitive and designed to help customers live a better life.

It was incorporated in 2014.\
\
* Who are the founders of the company?\
It is founded by Daniel Eberhard.\
\
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?\
The idea behind the company came after seeing the retirement plan of Canadians. Daniel noticed the top investment in Canada eats the 30-50% of Canadian\'92s retirement. Also, two-thirds of Canadians don\'92t have enough for the account minimums that top banks require to avoid the service fees. Daniel started the company to make banking simpler, transparent and cost-effective.\

In 2015, Koho raised around $1 million from undisclosed investors. While in 2017, they raised around $8 million which was sponsored by Power Financial Corp., Great-West Life Inc. and IGN Financial Inc. Koho recently raised $210 million as they are looking to expand. \

\
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)\
A major difference between Koho and its competitors that offer Visa debit seems to be who they are targeting. Koho seems more fit for daily use with 0.5% cash on all purchases while other companies boast their 0% foreign exchange fee. \
\
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing\'96\'96 you may want to search the company\'92s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)\
Koho is only available on the application and not on the web. Setting up an account only takes a couple of minutes. Koho uses data from customers\'92 spending to provide a personalized customer experience which helps the customers to spend wisely.\

\

\
## Recommendations\
\
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)\
\
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?\
I would suggest the company should get into lending as inflation is increasing and more people are looking out for ways to get loans for various reasons. This will help the company to reach more customers in remote areas as well. There are people genuine people who are looking for loans and are capable of paying them back on time but are not able to get them due to the tight banking sector rules. This could be the perfect time to get into the service line.\
\
They can also offer better rewards options and various payment methods. As there are so many companies testing Face ID payment options, Koho should try researching too. Although it can be an expensive investment, it can be worth the shot. \
\
Launching Digital Currency will boost the market reach as more companies have started accepting digital currencies. \
\
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?\
The technologies required for the additional service line will be Data Analysis and blockchain.\
\
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?\
These technologies are needed to process the payments securely. It will also help all eligible customers to receive funding easily and instantly whenever required.\
